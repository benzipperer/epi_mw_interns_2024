### Two countries
  - 20 states still follow federal minimum wage
  - 40% of workforce in states/cities scheduled to reach $15
  - 22 states have tipped subminimum wage less than $3.00
  - 8 states where tipped = regular minimum

# Review of minimum wage research
---

# Minimum wage research before 1990s
* Typically large, negative employment effects, especially on younger
workers (teenagers)

* Younger workers do see a significant hourly wage increase, but the
loss in employment causes them to have no annual income gains

* Convinced economists that minimum wage was at best ineffective, at
worst harmful

# Card &amp; Krueger 1994 NJ-PA comparisons
.center[![:scale 75%](ckabstract.png)]

* Fast-food employment change in New Jersey (treated group): `\(\Delta \textrm{NJ} = \textrm{NJ}_\textrm{after} - \textrm{NJ}_\textrm{before}\)`

* Fast-food employment change in Pennsylvania (control group): `\(\Delta \textrm{PA} = \textrm{PA}_\textrm{after} - \textrm{PA}_\textrm{before}\)`

* Estimated effect of minimum wage = `\(\Delta \textrm{NJ} - \Delta \textrm{PA}\)`

---
# Card &amp; Krueger NJ-PA comparisons
.center[![:scale 75%](ckmap.png)]

**"The increase in New Jersey's minimum wage probably had no effect on total employment in New Jersey's fast-food industry, and possibly had a small positive effect."**

Card and Krueger, *American Economic Review*, 2000

---
# Generalizing NJ-PA comparison
* Most important objection to NJ-PA study: only one case study
* Dube Lester Reich (2010) generalized the approach to minimum wage increases in 300 pairs of contiguous counties over 1990-2006
![](dlr_map.png)
* DLR (2010) found large increases in restaurant earnings with no fall in employment
---

# Recent developments
The new generation of Card-Krueger-inspired work used transparent, local comparisons (good!) ... BUT ...

1. Much of this work focused on restaurants or teenagers, a minority of low-wage workers

2. Also much of this work did not clearly show wage/employment changes where (and only where!) you would expect to see them at the bottom of wage distribution

3. Little research on how wage/employment effects may vary depending on whether the minimum wage increases are large or small

&lt;br&gt;
CDLZ (2019) develops methods to address these weaknesses:

* Examines 138 state-level minimum wage increases
* calculate employment effects throughout the entire distribution
* assesses overall employment and wage impact for low-wage workers

# Own-wage elasticity
### Basic definition
How does employment of group of workers respond to an increase in the average wage of that group induced by the minimum wage?

`$$OWE = \frac{\textrm{% employment change}}{\textrm{% average wage change}}$$`
&lt;br&gt;
### Hypothetical example OWE = -0.20 
* Implies 10% increase in hourly wages reduces employment by 2%
* This means total wage bill rises by about 10% - 2% = 8%
* Total wage income rises when OWE &gt; -1 
* Dube (2019) suggests OWE &lt; -0.4 is "small"

# Dube Lester Reich (2010) main result
In practice you may see 
`$$OWE = \frac{\left(\frac{\textrm{% employment change}}{\textrm{% minimum wage change}}\right)}{\left(\frac{\textrm{% average wage change}}{\textrm{% minimum wage change}}\right)}$$`
&lt;br&gt;

# Review of existing OWE estimates

.pull-left[
#### Dube (2019) review for UK Government
- 55 studies since Card &amp; Krueger (1994) that calculate OWE
- Median OWE, any group = -0.17
- Median OWE, low-wage workers = -0.04
- 70% of estimates "small"
- only 4 studies with OWE &lt; -1

&lt;br&gt;
#### CBO (2021)'s evaluation of $15 in 2025
- Assumed low-wage OWE = -0.48 (**!!**)
- Job loss from $15 in 2025 `\(\Rightarrow\)` 1,400,000
- But Dube (2019)'s estimates `\(\Rightarrow\)` 116,000

# Labor market adjustments

---
# How does the labor market adjust?

### The perfectly competitive model of the labor market:
- The old-fashioned conventional view of economists is that workers are paid solely according to their productivity. 
- If there is a minimum wage, employment clearly falls because
  - Some workers will no longer be productive enough to hire
  - Some firms will go out of business

### Then why do we see little-to-no job loss?
- The perfectly competitive model is wrong.
- More generally, there are several "channels of adjustment", as described in Schmitt (2015).
  - Specifically, let's focus on Turnover, Prices, Reallocation.

---
# Adjustment #1: Turnover
- Low-wage labor market has tremendous employee turnover. In bottom quantile of wages:
    - Every month, 10% of workers becomes newly employed/non-employed
    - Every 3 months, 20% of workers becomes newly employed/non-employed

- Employers of low-wage labor they set wages low enough such that they have vacancies and workers leaving jobs
    - Higher wages actually make it easier to recruit/retain
    - These savings reduce the costs of minimum wage policy

- Dube Lester Reich (2016) show after minimum wage increases, restaurants
    - hire fewer workers
    - but fewer workers leave their job
    - overall no net effect on employment
---

# Adjustment #2: Prices
- Empirical evidence is clear that firms raise prices to cover increased labor costs
- Perfectly competitive model predicts these price increases will lower demand and hence employment
  - Consumer demand in reality seems price inelastic when many firms have small price increases
  - Minimum wage helps to solve labor cost-price coordination problem.

---

# Adjustment #3: Reallocation

Null effects on employment mask significant churn among firms and workers.

&lt;br&gt;
Dustmann et al (2022) found German minimum wage (affected 15% of workforce) had
  - no effect on total number of low-wage workers
  - caused low-wage workers to move to larger, higher wage businesses with more full-time jobs
  - very small businesses more likely to shut down and average employment size went up

&lt;br&gt;  
Aaronson et al (2018) found minimum wages increase the number of US restaurants 
  - going out of business, AND
  - going into business

# Consequences of minimum wages

- **Job loss historically is relatively minimal**, much lower than naive predictions
  - Median estimate in literature (and best estimates) imply low-wage workers have more income after minimum wage increases
  
- **Turnover reductions** imply that, even if there is job loss, "cost" of job loss is dispersed and not concentrated:
  - Lower employment in a high turnover labor market means more weeks in-between jobs, but earning more at work
  - Combined with OWE estimates, low-wage workers benefit from higher incomes even if there is job loss

- **Consumer price increases** mean the minimum wage helps to reduce inequality: redistributes income from higher wage consumers to lower-wage workers.

- **Reallocation** means minimum wage can upgrade the composition of employment 
  - Low-productivity employers may go out of business
  - But closures do not reduce worker incomes or employment levels
